      <p>I am a marketing professional carrying nearly ten years of experience in the field. I am passionate about this industry because it allows me to use both my creative and analytical sides. 
        <br>
        The focus of my career thus far has been generating campaign strategies that yield an increase in brand awareness and lead generation. With a dramatic shift in marketing, success rides on digital efforts. Therefore, I have advanced my skills to include web design and web development to create sites that convert leads into customers. 
        <br>
        I am continuously learning new skills, and carry several certifications from sources including HubSpot, Google, SEM Rush, UCF Coding Bootcamp.
        <br>
        As a born and raised Floridian, I am proud to be an FSU alumni with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Marketing. In my spare time, I practice yoga, read books that focus on self-development, and spend Sundays with my family as an Italian tradition.
